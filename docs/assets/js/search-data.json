They cannot be given anyway,because you would not be able to live them. For everything is to be lived.\n\nLive the questions now. Perhaps you then may gradually, without noticing, one day in the future, live into the answers. Perhaps you bear within yourself the capacity to imagine and shape a sacred way of life. Prepare yourself for that. Trust what comes to you.\" - Rainer Maria Rilke","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/ZYz3QAtDEXJra7D0sKGwW.html","relUrl":"notes/ZYz3QAtDEXJra7D0sKGwW.html"},{"doc":"Solitude","title":"Solitude","hpath":"words.solitude","content":"\n\n---\n[[daily.journal.2021.10.18]]\n\n\"But everything that perhaps one day will be possible can already now be prepared by the lone individual and shaped with his own hands. Therefore, dear sir, love your solitude and turn the distress it brings you into resonant laments. For you say that those close to you seem distant, and that shows that you are allowing more space around you. If what is close feels far, then your horizon has widened. Be glad for the way you are growing, which is your way, a way you cannot expect of others. Be patient and calm with those who are stuck, and don't torment yourself because they cannot understand your convictions or your joy. Seek with them some simple and true togetherness that does not change when you change. Treasure the life in them as that of another life-form that fears soliutude, and be considerate of those who are afraid to be alone.\" - Rainer Maria Rilke \n- This is an incredibly poignant paragraph. Spoke with a friend recently who mentioned they spent a day in their apartment alone and couldn't imagine doing that for a long period of time. There is great fear of being alone\n\n\"your solitude amid unfamiliar circumstances will be haven and home for you, from which, going forth, you will find your way.\"\n- Following on the previous quote, if we can find a home in our solitude, then we will have the freedom to find our own way in this world. It cannot be guaranteed that we will have company all the time when we accept the call to find our own unique calling. Find comfort in solitude will give you peace no matter where the world takes you on your journey.","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/ElCWsYYxZ6SwGj7rU6Ygu.html","relUrl":"notes/ElCWsYYxZ6SwGj7rU6Ygu.html"},{"doc":"Create","title":"Create","hpath":"words.create","content":"\n[[daily.journal.2021.10.18]]\n\n\"","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/0oSnjy3OA5JuFwsNG1qbq.html","relUrl":"notes/0oSnjy3OA5JuFwsNG1qbq.html"},{"doc":"Collective Intelligence","title":"Collective Intelligence","hpath":"words.collective-intelligence","content":"\n[[daily.journal.2021.10.18]]\n\n\"The art of creating is nothing without the vast ongoing participation and collaboration of the real world, nothing without the thousandfold harmonizing of things and beings; and the creator's pleasure is thereby inexpressibly rich because it contains memories of the begetting and bearing of millions.

With utter humility and patience, await the hour when a new clarity is delivered.

Trust this will take you where you need to go.\n\n\"Time eludes measurement. What is a year? And ten years are nothing. To be an artist means not to count or reckon but to ripen like the tree that does not force its sap and, trustingly, stands through the storms of spring without fear that summer will not come. It will come. But it comes only to the patient ones, who stand there with eternity stretching around them, quiet, vast, and free of worry. I learn this every day, learn it amid struggle, for which I am thankful. Patience is all!\" - Rainer Maria Rilke\n- Life is not a race to hit certain achievements. Give yourself the time to become who you are. \n\n[Mark Ravenhill's Edinburgh festival speech: 'We need to have a plan B'](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/03/mark-ravenhill-edinburgh-festival-speech-full-text)\n- to be a good artist you have to be the person who walks in to a space with integrity and tells the truth. That's what marks you out from the audience and why they're sitting over there and you're standing up there: you are the most truthful person in that room.\n- The paradigm has shifted and new ways of living and behaving are going to be needed if we're going to make our way forward.\n- Artists are the ones who have the freedom if you choose to use it to think of new possibilities, crazy ideas, bold, idealistic, irrational, counter-intuitive, disruptive, naughty, angry words and deeds.\n- freedom to think the impossible but of course the freedom to choose what to think is a difficult place to get to and often an economically costly one.\n- Don't look for business models from last year. Make it up as you go along. Do everything as if for the first time.\n- But you're artists – and the wonderful thing about being an artist is that any of those choices and many many more are choices that you can make. You're our dreamers, our explorers of new possibilities and we've never needed you more than we do today.\n\nIt’s hard to resist a system alone but if you can bring a group of people together, they can resist the systems.

So many things that are like this. Much of visual perception as well\n        - The mythical quality of music. In it's melody and sounds, the entire world is called upon. Every emotion, every memory shared by thousands.\n- People discussing their favorite songs\n    - Talking about things in the world. A rich layer of symbols and creation that make up our world\n    - We connect across space and time because of the creations of others. The stories we’ve accumulated and shared. Compressing values, interests and identity into packages that can be shared by many. Songs, movies, books, ideas, art, people, places, hobbies, games. Creating spaces to meet through creation.\n \n\nTruth won’t be found sitting in front of a computer. Too much can’t be captured in that medium, yet. Much must be discovered on the road.\n- \"What is the nature of the search? you ask. Really it is very simple; at least for a fellow like me. So simple that it is easily overlooked. The search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life.\" - The Moviegoer by Walker Percy\n\nDigital space has a funny quality to it. If you stop participating, you disappear. You in a sense, die. The algorithms are optimized for surfacing the latest. Anything great in the past is lost. If you try to start sharing again, it's like sharing into the ether until the algorithms deem you worthy to be surfaced in the feed again.\n\nFunny that when I type on a keyboard, creativity is limited to a certain set of symbols.

This requires a great deal of skill on the part of the children, and uses up the parents' love, that can weave and warm even when it doesn't understand. Seek of them no counsel and count on no understanding; but believe in a love that has been preserved for you like a legacy, and trust that, in this love, there is strength you don't have to leave behind.\" - Rainer Maria Rilke\n- It is okay if in later life that you don't completely resonate with parents or feel understood. It doesn't mean you must alienate them. Can accept a love that was laid at the early stages of your life. One that remains regardless of what happens.","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/W6RGH1Xr6v6nzYVqz2RN2.html","relUrl":"notes/W6RGH1Xr6v6nzYVqz2RN2.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
