Therefore, dear sir, love your solitude and turn the distress it brings you into resonant laments. For you say that those close to you seem distant, and that shows that you are allowing more space around you. If what is close feels far, then your horizon has widened. Be glad for the way you are growing, which is your way, a way you cannot expect of others. Be patient and calm with those who are stuck, and don't torment yourself because they cannot understand your convictions or your joy. Seek with them some simple and true togetherness that does not change when you change. Treasure the life in them as that of another life-form that fears soliutude, and be considerate of those who are afraid to be alone.\" - Rainer Maria Rilke \n- This is an incredibly poignant paragraph.

That's what marks you out from the audience and why they're sitting over there and you're standing up there: you are the most truthful person in that room.\n- The paradigm has shifted and new ways of living and behaving are going to be needed if we're going to make our way forward.\n- Artists are the ones who have the freedom if you choose to use it to think of new possibilities, crazy ideas, bold, idealistic, irrational, counter-intuitive, disruptive, naughty, angry words and deeds.\n- freedom to think the impossible but of course the freedom to choose what to think is a difficult place to get to and often an economically costly one.\n- Don't look for business models from last year. Make it up as you go along. Do everything as if for the first time.\n- But you're artists – and the wonderful thing about being an artist is that any of those choices and many many more are choices that you can make.

When you're in that psychological state of fear, you can develop toxic relationships that are clingy. Where someone seems like you're their last thread to humanity or vice versa. That maybe there is an educational component to helping with that fear. Realizing that a part of it is not your fault. Society is structured in a very individualistic way and you could survive without a tribe which many do. Work doesn't help either since people are more mobile and may move for work to a place where they have a small or non-existent network.\n\nHowever, personally, I've felt that it's been valuable to learn how to spend time alone. To realize you're okay in that state. That you can actually be happy. Life is very mobile and if you want to embrace all the possible advantages of this day and age, there will be times when you are alone. These times for me have often been incredibly reflective. I've stepped away from the memetic desires (see [[daily.journal.2021.10.22]]) and am able to think about what I truly want in life. To see clearly the parts that weren't healthy for me and which parts I'd like to try to create more of. More time means an ability to hone new skills, read new books and get to know ourselves. \n\nA useful framing that I've come to learn recently is Internal Family Systems. That our self is actually composed of many individuals. You have the selfish self, the loving self, the studious self, the five year old self, the dancing self. Get to know these individuals. Understand where there is conflict between them and help facilitate healthy relationships between them just like you could for a family.\n\nAn interesting point one person brought up was that they are okay if one person doesn't fulfill all their needs. They have their intellectual friends, their party friends, hiking friends etc.\n- What fascinates me about this is that for a tine, I had begun to romanticize the re-tribalization of society. Groups of friends moving off together to live village-like lives. However, the major issue with this is that if everyone did it, it would be a massive urban sprawl which has large negative impact on the planet. [Simon Sarris](https://twitter.com/simonsarris) is kind of the leader of this group in my mind. \n- What I think we need more of are people sharing possible futures where living in cities is more desirable. To romanticize it again. \n\nTying this all together, mobility enables the ability to meet more people. Some we may resonate with more than others but regardless, we create opportunities to deepen our empathy for our shared humanity. Life can be much more dynamic. We can spend periods of time with people in person and find ourselves discovering new directions because of it that are more inline with who we are as a person. Temporary tribes that sprout up in moments where people are feeling highly aligned and then split up again to find new groups. Allowing deep knowledge, experience, lessons to disseminate further.\n\n---\n\nDecent framing for intelligence augmentation\n\nIt's about creating symbiotic relationships between computers and human users.\n\nOn the internal side, helping us pattern match based on all the information we are recording and collecting. Making inferences about our internal mental models based on how we use words in relation to each other. Helping us see the bigger picture and to reflect on what this might mean for us moving forward. Maybe suggesting an interesting, unexpected career path or a topic you should really explore more in depth. Connecting you to groups and organizations that may be able to enhance your understanding.\n\nOn the external side, helping us communicate and express ourselves. Thinking about new mediums for communication. What can we do with the digital medium that wasn't possible before? This is both an art and technology question. Computers to this day are largely document based which just carries over the metaphors of physical paper when information was stored on individual sheets (documents).","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/Kx0GadNRPDWvbVqKCb4g9.html","relUrl":"notes/Kx0GadNRPDWvbVqKCb4g9.html"},{"doc":"2021-10-22","title":"2021-10-22","hpath":"daily.journal.2021.10.22","content":"\nMemetic species\n\nWe want the things that other people want.

So much wasted time going into random obscure stackoverflows to find your error. If I am ever in charge of doing developer docs, my goal will be to get people up and running as quickly as possible. But then to also make sure things are actually documented well so people understand data flow. The nuances of various functions. An understanding of what you can pass into an `options` arg.\n\n---\n\nWhat do I want to explore next?\n\nMoney is energy. We spend money to eat, move, learn (information compression making reality easier to navigate). Digital currency creates new ways to exchange money with each other quickly. What happens when we have this more nuanced, socio-programmatic medium for tranfering energy? What is enabled?\n\nHow we move more of the population into a high agency state? To create more things and to exercise their imaginations. The world is an incredibly malleable place and the walls will move quite easily if you give them a honest push. How do you create an onramp of opportunities that slowly increase the amount of agency someone believes they have?\n- I think part of this question is actually a social question. It's about how we bring people together. To get people exerting positive peer pressure on each other to push the boundaries of what they believe is possible. Because a lot of what we think are limiting rules are psychological barriers. We can push on them and discover they never existed. \n- Most recently for me, thinking I needed to progress through the levels for bouldering sequentially. First complete all the V3s, then V4s, etc. But instead I jumped a few levels. Completed two V5s and yet still struggle on V3s occasionally. \n- Education seems like a possibility too. But in particular, education focused on action. People need to see cause and effect. To realize their actions had some outcome rather than being stuck in this theoretical bubble. I studied AI in college yet don't feel comfortable actually implementing any of it. The best AI people I know just learned it through play on their own. A lot of the great games begin as single player experiences. Then when you get good enough, you start teaming up with other people to tackle the big boss battles (hard problems).\n- Education actually has two parts. You first need to be aware of what exists out there to learn. You then need to take actions that assimilate that information into lived experiences. A technical friend called this the `npm install` phase of learning. Identify the ideas, models, tools, skills you need and then take action to install the modules. On this front, creating things and interfacing with the world will have the highest return on investment. Hackathons, personal projects, viral social posts, sales, etc.\n\n\nWTF is happening in Crypto?\n- Space has changed a lot since my time at Consensys in 2017. \n- A lot of focus on onboarding & education. These will always be valuable companies for any emerging technology. \n- Defi blew up. Don't know much about it yet\n- NFTs giving people liquidity and scarcity on digital goods. \n- DAOs creating new opportunities for people to collaborate in novel ways. How novel are these things? What actually wasn't possible before? Many of these things are really just easier now. (kickstarter, revenue share, auctions, gated communities). Easier is good. But what is truly novel? Trying to cut through the noise.\n- My interest in the space is how this might create new opportunities for people to collaborate in financial ways. Can join together for a short period of time, take on a quest together and then disband. Or work being more like an MMO. You may have your main quest but can always take breaks to do side quests. Sometimes may gain skills, reputation, items, connections etc. on those side quests that help you in the main quest. The purpose of side quests in video games was to encourage exploration into new areas that you might otherwise not explore. Areas may be unique, hard to reach, frontier lands. \n- The beauty of a sidequest is that you get to untether yourself from the core storyline. Can do weird stuff and combine ideas in unexpected ways. Can be more playful and fun. Don't have to be as focused. And in that space created, you have this ability to introduce and teach to players (individuals) who are going to be more receptive. And maybe they surprise themselves picking up skills they didn't expect but actually love doing or using. Wonder what sidequests in education looks like\n\nSlapped this message together and sent to a friend\n\n> Was just thinking about MMOs and the value of doing sidequests. They may unlock novel items, experience, etc that could come in handy for your main quest line. In particular, side quests focus on nudging the player to explore frontier domains. The less traveled paths.\n\n>Similarly, in life and learning, I think the same value applies to side quests. Wondering what type of side quests are most valuable (probably depends on what your main quest is) and how do you encourage more people to take the time to do them?\n\n---\n\n[How to tell great spoken stories](https://www.julian.com/blog/storytelling)\n\n## Witholding information\n- Raising questions but not giving the full answer.\n- Sharing the stakes of a story but not giving away the conclusion.\n- Sharing a shocking truth but not yet explaining how it’s possible.\n\n[On play](https://matthewsiu.substack.com/p/on-play)\n- I talk about this technique of witholding information through the model of \"anticpation and subsequent reveal\". Constantly be building up anticipation through questions and then answer some. Maybe leave some open for the community to ponder in more detail themselves. This is for both fiction and non-fiction. Ultimately, a great piece of writing gets someone to think about it. To try to integrate what they've read into their models of reality and to be able to act on a better model.\n\n## Rhythmic quality\n- Varying your speed\n- Varying your volume\n- Varying your enthusiasm and energy\n- Using staccato and rhythm\n- And most of all vocal delivery is the art of pausing.\n\n[Writing, Miyazaki and MMOs](https://matthewsiu.substack.com/p/writing-miyazaki-and-mmos)\n- I talk about Dr.Suess' Anapestic Tetrameter technique in this piece. And even use it in the end. \n> There is a magic we create in the stories we tell. In the worlds that we make from the words that we write.\n\n---\n\n## Noise\n\nThe world has so much fucking noise. Information is abundant. Everyone is trying to get your attention. Most information on the internet is low quality marketing. If you want to have novel ideas, you've got to get away from the center. You've got to go on a great adventure, discover new things and assimiilate those back to the center. I think this is the reason why I'm always weary of programs, classes etc. Becuase I believe the things worth learning can't be packaged up so easily. If you can package up a skill and distribute it to the millions, it's been commoditized. For me, that's uninteresting.\n\nI'm reaching the point with my skills where I'm starting to get a lot of job offers. This is also a sort of noise. Figuring out which one truly calls to you. Putting aside all possible extrinsic motivators and really considering which one moves you closer to a state of being where you are happy. In all honesty, I think the long term path here is to start your own thing. That way it combines everything that you've learned on your journey in life. However, in the meantime, picking the right company, organizations, projects that seem to move you closer to your values is key.\n\nAnd then leaving plenty of free time to just play. To be surprised. To say yes to something unexpected. Because reality is millions of times larger than you will ever know. And if you try to plan your life based on the tiniest sliver of it that you are aware of, you will miss so much. So leave plenty of time to experiment and play. To explore.

A rich layer of symbols and creation that make up our world\n    - We connect across space and time because of the creations of others. The stories we’ve accumulated and shared. Compressing values, interests and identity into packages that can be shared by many. Songs, movies, books, ideas, art, people, places, hobbies, games. Creating spaces to meet through creation.\n \n\nTruth won’t be found sitting in front of a computer. Too much can’t be captured in that medium, yet.

This requires a great deal of skill on the part of the children, and uses up the parents' love, that can weave and warm even when it doesn't understand. Seek of them no counsel and count on no understanding; but believe in a love that has been preserved for you like a legacy, and trust that, in this love, there is strength you don't have to leave behind.\" - Rainer Maria Rilke\n- It is okay if in later life that you don't completely resonate with parents or feel understood. It doesn't mean you must alienate them. Can accept a love that was laid at the early stages of your life. One that remains regardless of what happens.","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/W6RGH1Xr6v6nzYVqz2RN2.html","relUrl":"notes/W6RGH1Xr6v6nzYVqz2RN2.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
