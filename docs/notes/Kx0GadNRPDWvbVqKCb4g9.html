<p>Talking to friends today about community, relationships, fear of being alone. When you're in that psychological state of fear, you can develop toxic relationships that are clingy. Where someone seems like you're their last thread to humanity or vice versa. That maybe there is an educational component to helping with that fear. Realizing that a part of it is not your fault. Society is structured in a very individualistic way and you could survive without a tribe which many do. Work doesn't help either since people are more mobile and may move for work to a place where they have a small or non-existent network.</p>
<p>However, personally, I've felt that it's been valuable to learn how to spend time alone. To realize you're okay in that state. That you can actually be happy. Life is very mobile and if you want to embrace all the possible advantages of this day and age, there will be times when you are alone. These times for me have often been incredibly reflective. I've stepped away from the memetic desires (see <a href="https://siunami.github.io/thought-space/notes/YX9vIBPMip6rshbPEWsaI.html">2021-10-22</a>) and am able to think about what I truly want in life. To see clearly the parts that weren't healthy for me and which parts I'd like to try to create more of. More time means an ability to hone new skills, read new books and get to know ourselves. </p>
<p>A useful framing that I've come to learn recently is Internal Family Systems. That our self is actually composed of many individuals. You have the selfish self, the loving self, the studious self, the five year old self, the dancing self. Get to know these individuals. Understand where there is conflict between them and help facilitate healthy relationships between them just like you could for a family.</p>
<p>An interesting point one person brought up was that they are okay if one person doesn't fulfill all their needs. They have their intellectual friends, their party friends, hiking friends etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>What fascinates me about this is that for a tine, I had begun to romanticize the re-tribalization of society. Groups of friends moving off together to live village-like lives. However, the major issue with this is that if everyone did it, it would be a massive urban sprawl which has large negative impact on the planet. <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris">Simon Sarris</a> is kind of the leader of this group in my mind. </li>
<li>What I think we need more of are people sharing possible futures where living in cities is more desirable. To romanticize it again. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tying this all together, mobility enables the ability to meet more people. Some we may resonate with more than others but regardless, we create opportunities to deepen our empathy for our shared humanity. Life can be much more dynamic. We can spend periods of time with people in person and find ourselves discovering new directions because of it that are more inline with who we are as a person. Temporary tribes that sprout up in moments where people are feeling highly aligned and then split up again to find new groups. Allowing deep knowledge, experience, lessons to disseminate further.</p>
<hr>
<p>Decent framing for intelligence augmentation</p>
<p>It's about creating symbiotic relationships between computers and human users.</p>
<p>On the internal side, helping us pattern match based on all the information we are recording and collecting. Making inferences about our internal mental models based on how we use words in relation to each other. Helping us see the bigger picture and to reflect on what this might mean for us moving forward. Maybe suggesting an interesting, unexpected career path or a topic you should really explore more in depth. Connecting you to groups and organizations that may be able to enhance your understanding.</p>
<p>On the external side, helping us communicate and express ourselves. Thinking about new mediums for communication. What can we do with the digital medium that wasn't possible before? This is both an art and technology question. Computers to this day are largely document based which just carries over the metaphors of physical paper when information was stored on individual sheets (documents).</p><span id="navId" data="Kx0GadNRPDWvbVqKCb4g9"></span>
