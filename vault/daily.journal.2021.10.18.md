Practicing being present and noticing the things around me
- Hot soup on a cold day. Each sip bringing life into the soul. The soup's warmth reaching back outwards and warming the bodies extremities
- Ukulele playing, people singing together. 
    - Switched to chanting music
        - Sweet, melodic, hopeful, reminiscent, dreaming, belief in the future, shouting to those lost, calm, present in the moment, movement and energy, building of awareness, flow, laughter, being in synchronicity with other humans. Howling into the wind. Yelling to the world and letting them know you exist.
        - Realizing that that it's incredibly hard to capture in words the beautiful nuances of sound. So many things that are like this. Much of visual perception as well
        - The mythical quality of music. In it's melody and sounds, the entire world is called upon. Every emotion, every memory shared by thousands.
- People discussing their favorite songs
    - Talking about things in the world. A rich layer of symbols and creation that make up our world
    - We connect across space and time because of the creations of others. The stories we’ve accumulated and shared. Compressing values, interests and identity into packages that can be shared by many. Songs, movies, books, ideas, art, people, places, hobbies, games. Creating spaces to meet through creation.
 

Truth won’t be found sitting in front of a computer. Too much can’t be captured in that medium, yet. Much must be discovered on the road.
- "What is the nature of the search? you ask. Really it is very simple; at least for a fellow like me. So simple that it is easily overlooked. The search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life." - The Moviegoer by Walker Percy

Digital space has a funny quality to it. If you stop participating, you disappear. You in a sense, die. The algorithms are optimized for surfacing the latest. Anything great in the past is lost. If you try to start sharing again, it's like sharing into the ether until the algorithms deem you worthy to be surfaced in the feed again.

Funny that when I type on a keyboard, creativity is limited to a certain set of symbols. Realizing that so much of life is just these little symbols we’ve collectively imagined. They are arbitrary. We can invent new ones and create new visuals for interacting with the world.


[Steve Jobs on Life and Experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPbcM5N5Sqg&ab_channel=JayJackson)

If you’re gonna make connections that are innovative
You’ve gotta get different experiences
Or else you’ll make the same connections
 
Go to Paris and be a poet for a few years
- Get really excited about a sport and try to master it
- Learn about the process for manufacturing an item in your house from raw material to your house. 
Or go to a third world country

Fall in love with two people at once

You’ll have pressure to walk some well defined path but don’t let that stop you from talking to other people

It is one of the most ecstatic things to contribute something back to this rich pool of ideas that we draw from each day.

Life

A play

Made for you

Moments full of color

Celebration, laughter, love, adventure, home

At other times, moments harboring monsters

Heartbreak, loneliness, depression, loss, fear, confusion

The richness of experience in each soul

As it navigates the calm and tumultuous seas

Seeking reason for the beautiful madness of our existence


#linestretching

### In flight
Grand cities melt into rural landscapes
- a sight that kings could only dream of

Try to hold onto the magic
- For the world holds limitless secrets and only one constraint

We consume borrowed time

I feel like people should start clapping when their plane touches down. Their pilots just successfully landed a 90,000 pound plane traveling 500+ miles per hour on a piece of asphalt. We’ve lost the magic

#snowball

Fire

Embers crackle

Stare deep enough

Into its glowing maw

And see the universe begin


We live in such a fascinating world but most people aren’t in a state of mind to see it
- I say this because I've been on both sides. Existing and going about the days passing most things by without a thought. Now, more recently, stopping to watch so many details because it's all incredibly interesting.

"Avoid adding fuel to the ever-present drama between parents and children. This requires a great deal of skill on the part of the children, and uses up the parents' love, that can weave and warm even when it doesn't understand. Seek of them no counsel and count on no understanding; but believe in a love that has been preserved for you like a legacy, and trust that, in this love, there is strength you don't have to leave behind." - Rainer Maria Rilke
- It is okay if in later life that you don't completely resonate with parents or feel understood. It doesn't mean you must alienate them. Can accept a love that was laid at the early stages of your life. One that remains regardless of what happens.
