Water systems
- What is the current state of fresh water storage in California?
- How do countries manage water usage for large bodies that flow through multiple countries? Ex: The Colorado river terminates in Tijuana

Porcelain
- How do you evaluate a piece of porcelain for quality?
- What is the history of porcelain? Originated somewhere? Or was a technique picked up by many cultures independently?

Construction
- Learned Mortise and Tenon from Robert. Would like to understand better 

How to make my favorite foods [[daily.journal.2021.10.18]]

Wonder if I could spend some time on a farm and pick up these techniques while helping out?


Place over time - a poetry project [[daily.journal.2021.10.18]]
- go to the same place multiple times and capture little bits of what you experience there. 
- How does perception of a place change over time?

Jazz Piano
- I love the back and forth, the improvisation of it.
- Sub goal: understanding deeper how music works. The chords and progressions.
    - Would then be relevant for other instruments too. Ukulele, guitar, etc.
