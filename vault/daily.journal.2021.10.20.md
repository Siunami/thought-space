The suggestion to take off shoes in the learning environment. It helps ground the individual to be physically connected to floor and increase learning potential

Just the presence of books and interesting things makes people more curious

People become more playful when the environment suggests it's okay. Ex: google slides

An environment where you can lay down, sit, stand. Act in the way you want to.

Nature connects you. A spiritual dimension

Perhaps the "no permission to do actual work" is an arbitrary blocker but it may help ensure the spread of the culture. People will appreaciate the accumulation of that skill more and want to share it.


## Agency

Reduce the friction to do an activity and more people will contribute.

AI generated imagery is fascinating because it has previously been a labor intensive task. The ability to generate inspiration for worlds and stories. Give the creatives material to work with and generate inspiration.

The ability to actualize imagination and dreams in visuals quite easily. Magical storytelling power. One day we'll be able to explore entire metaverses imagined in our heads. And invite others to explore it with us! These rich worlds of imagination customized for your personal interests.


## Cities

Place to take notes on places or perform creative city-related exercises (photowalks, experience maps, etc.) to contribute to a global psychogeographer handbook

Maps, maps, maps
- Map of little free libraries
- Can you use the little free libraries for new activities? Leaving notes or thoughts?
- Thoughts of the town
- Conversation spaces attached to a library. Does anyone have this book? Kickstarting the distributed library
- Fairy doors, QR code inside leading to a conversation space.
- Map of emotions (how does a place make you feel)

How to unlock the stored potential energy of a person‚Äôs audience.

Allow people to specify some location, puzzle/story to get the location.

Have guilds in various cities
- Ex: Typographers guild
- Run by the people

Poets guild
- Put up obscure words and their definitions

Sticker club

- Being able to throw stickers up around your location
- Kind of empowering in a way. Its own tiny revolution to be able to throw up these symbols (an idea, philosophy, values) in a place.

- QR code gives you access to a map that you can then explore. A poetry crawl. A very consumptive experience. How you can make this a dynamic back and forth conversation.
- Leads to a tree with poems hanging, paper and pencils to write your own

what if we collectively rented 1-bedrooms and turned them into small  collectively owned libraries / third spaces? tokens could provide access / allow for you to borrow books. we‚Äôd be able to set collaborative/sharing norms - e.g.‚Äúheavy marginalia welcome‚Äù
