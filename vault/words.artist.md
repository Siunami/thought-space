"Let every impression and every kernel of feeling complete itself in the dark, in the unsayable, unconscious, unreachable by the daylight mind. With utter humility and patience, await the hour when a new clarity is delivered. That is what it means to be an artist, in your understanding as well as in your creating." - Rainer Maria Rilke
- Be present. Preceive. Trust this will take you where you need to go.

"Time eludes measurement. What is a year? And ten years are nothing. To be an artist means not to count or reckon but to ripen like the tree that does not force its sap and, trustingly, stands through the storms of spring without fear that summer will not come. It will come. But it comes only to the patient ones, who stand there with eternity stretching around them, quiet, vast, and free of worry. I learn this every day, learn it amid struggle, for which I am thankful. Patience is all!" - Rainer Maria Rilke
- Life is not a race to hit certain achievements. Give yourself the time to become who you are. 

[Mark Ravenhill's Edinburgh festival speech: 'We need to have a plan B'](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/03/mark-ravenhill-edinburgh-festival-speech-full-text)
- to be a good artist you have to be the person who walks in to a space with integrity and tells the truth. That's what marks you out from the audience and why they're sitting over there and you're standing up there: you are the most truthful person in that room.
- The paradigm has shifted and new ways of living and behaving are going to be needed if we're going to make our way forward.
- Artists are the ones who have the freedom if you choose to use it to think of new possibilities, crazy ideas, bold, idealistic, irrational, counter-intuitive, disruptive, naughty, angry words and deeds.
- freedom to think the impossible but of course the freedom to choose what to think is a difficult place to get to and often an economically costly one.
- Don't look for business models from last year. Make it up as you go along. Do everything as if for the first time.
- But you're artists – and the wonderful thing about being an artist is that any of those choices and many many more are choices that you can make. You're our dreamers, our explorers of new possibilities and we've never needed you more than we do today.

It’s hard to resist a system alone but if you can bring a group of people together, they can resist the systems. Connect the pioneers together to form a [connected adjacency](https://redefineschool.com/connected-adjacency/)

If we want to create spaces that are safe for the soul, we need to understand why the soul so rarely shows up in everyday life. - Parker Palmer
