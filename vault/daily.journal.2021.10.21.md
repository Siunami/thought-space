Navigating horrible developer docs. So much wasted time going into random obscure stackoverflows to find your error. If I am ever in charge of doing developer docs, my goal will be to get people up and running as quickly as possible. But then to also make sure things are actually documented well so people understand data flow. The nuances of various functions. An understanding of what you can pass into an `options` arg.

What do I want to explore next?

Money is energy. We spend money to eat, move, learn (information compression making reality easier to navigate). Digital currency creates new ways to exchange money with each other quickly. What happens when we have this more nuanced, socio-programmatic medium for tranfering energy? What is enabled?

How we move more of the population into a high agency state? To create more things and to exercise their imaginations. The world is an incredibly malleable place and the walls will move quite easily if you give them a honest push. How do you create an onramp of opportunities that slowly increase the amount of agency someone believes they have?
- I think part of this question is actually a social question. It's about how we bring people together. To get people exerting positive peer pressure on each other to push the boundaries of what they believe is possible. Because a lot of what we think are limiting rules are psychological barriers. We can push on them and discover they never existed. 
- Most recently for me, thinking I needed to progress through the levels for bouldering sequentially. First complete all the V3s, then V4s, etc. But instead I jumped a few levels. Completed two V5s and yet still struggle on V3s occasionally. 
- Education seems like a possibility too. But in particular, education focused on action. People need to see cause and effect. To realize their actions had some outcome rather than being stuck in this theoretical bubble. I studied AI in college yet don't feel comfortable actually implementing any of it. The best AI people I know just learned it through play on their own. A lot of the great games begin as single player experiences. Then when you get good enough, you start teaming up with other people to tackle the big boss battles (hard problems).
- Education actually has two parts. You first need to be aware of what exists out there to learn. You then need to take actions that assimilate that information into lived experiences. A technical friend called this the `npm install` phase of learning. Identify the ideas, models, tools, skills you need and then take action to install the modules. On this front, creating things and interfacing with the world will have the highest return on investment. Hackathons, personal projects, viral social posts, sales, etc.


WTF is happening in Crypto?
- Space has changed a lot since my time at Consensys in 2017. 
- A lot of focus on onboarding & education. These will always be valuable companies for any emerging technology. 
- Defi blew up. Don't know much about it yet
- NFTs giving people liquidity and scarcity on digital goods. 
- DAOs creating new opportunities for people to collaborate in novel ways. How novel are these things? What actually wasn't possible before? Many of these things are really just easier now. (kickstarter, revenue share, auctions, gated communities). Easier is good. But what is truly novel? Trying to cut through the noise.
- My interest in the space is how this might create new opportunities for people to collaborate in financial ways. Can join together for a short period of time, take on a quest together and then disband. Or work being more like an MMO. You may have your main quest but can always take breaks to do side quests. Sometimes may gain skills, reputation, items, connections etc. on those side quests that help you in the main quest. The purpose of side quests in video games was to encourage exploration into new areas that you might otherwise not explore. Areas may be unique, hard to reach, frontier lands. 
- The beauty of a sidequest is that you get to untether yourself from the core storyline. Can do weird stuff and combine ideas in unexpected ways. Can be more playful and fun. Don't have to be as focused. And in that space created, you have this ability to introduce and teach to players (individuals) who are going to be more receptive. And maybe they surprise themselves picking up skills they didn't expect but actually love doing or using. Wonder what sidequests in education looks like

Slapped this message together and sent to a friend

> Was just thinking about MMOs and the value of doing sidequests. They may unlock novel items, experience, etc that could come in handy for your main quest line. In particular, side quests focus on nudging the player to explore frontier domains. The less traveled paths.

>Similarly, in life and learning, I think the same value applies to side quests. Wondering what type of side quests are most valuable (probably depends on what your main quest is) and how do you encourage more people to take the time to do them?

[How to tell great spoken stories](https://www.julian.com/blog/storytelling)

## Witholding information
- Raising questions but not giving the full answer.
- Sharing the stakes of a story but not giving away the conclusion.
- Sharing a shocking truth but not yet explaining how itâ€™s possible.

[On play](https://matthewsiu.substack.com/p/on-play)
- I talk about this technique of witholding information through the model of "anticpation and subsequent reveal". Constantly be building up anticipation through questions and then answer some. Maybe leave some open for the community to ponder in more detail themselves. This is for both fiction and non-fiction. Ultimately, a great piece of writing gets someone to think about it. To try to integrate what they've read into their models of reality and to be able to act on a better model.

## Rhythmic quality
- Varying your speed
- Varying your volume
- Varying your enthusiasm and energy
- Using staccato and rhythm
- And most of all vocal delivery is the art of pausing.

[Writing, Miyazaki and MMOs](https://matthewsiu.substack.com/p/writing-miyazaki-and-mmos)
- I talk about Dr.Suess' Anapestic Tetrameter technique in this piece. And even use it in the end. 
> There is a magic we create in the stories we tell. In the worlds that we make from the words that we write.

## Noise

The world has so much fucking noise. Information is abundant. Everyone is trying to get your attention. Most information on the internet is low quality marketing. If you want to have novel ideas, you've got to get away from the center. You've got to go on a great adventure, discover new things and assimiilate those back to the center. I think this is the reason why I'm always weary of programs, classes etc. Becuase I believe the things worth learning can't be packaged up so easily. If you can package up a skill and distribute it to the millions, it's been commoditized. For me, that's uninteresting.

I'm reaching the point with my skills where I'm starting to get a lot of job offers. This is also a sort of noise. Figuring out which one truly calls to you. Putting aside all possible extrinsic motivators and really considering which one moves you closer to a state of being where you are happy. In all honesty, I think the long term path here is to start your own thing. That way it combines everything that you've learned on your journey in life. However, in the meantime, picking the right company, organizations, projects that seem to move you closer to your values is key.

And then leaving plenty of free time to just play. To be surprised. To say yes to something unexpected. Because reality is millions of times larger than you will ever know. And if you try to plan your life based on the tiniest sliver of it that you are aware of, you will miss so much. So leave plenty of time to experiment and play. To explore. (Maybe this is why I'm so fascinated with helping people have increased agency and in sidequests)
