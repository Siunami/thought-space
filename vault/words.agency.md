[The Most Precious Resource is Agency](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)
- "Gaining agency is gaining the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you. "
- "The world until recently was overflowing with onramps of opportunity, even for children, and we seem to do poorly at producing new ones."
- "Much of the fault for this lies in an attempt at systematizing skill and knowledge transfer so thoroughly that people begin to conceive of it as the task of school, rather than a normal consequence of work."
- "It seems that the more you ask of people, and the more you have them do, the more they are able to later do on their own."
- "The act of creation causes imagination, not the other way around. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters the unique. Agency is precious because the lucidities that purposeful work and responsibility bring are the real education. The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing."

We must create opportunities and reduce friction for children and people of all ages to exercise their creativity. Without it, we lose agency and belief in our ability affect the world.

Constrained writing techniques make creation feel like a game. You don't realize it in the moment because it feels fun to generate new things and be surprised by what you discover. The funny, unexpected connections.

Doing these with friends too makes it feel like a game where people are riffing off of each other. For example, the [erasure](https://twitter.com/MatthewWSiu/status/1449542703864111109?s=20) technique. Having multiple people try this on the same piece of text leads to drastically different outcomes.



Text to image AI is also fascinating in this realm. Allowing people incredible creative leverage with a small amount of effort (reduced friction). You also have the game part of it where it's exciting to see what will get generated next based on the prompt you give it. 

Creating more of these opportunities for surprise whether it self directed (constrained writing) or through interactions with people and programs.
