"But everything that perhaps one day will be possible can already now be prepared by the lone individual and shaped with his own hands. Therefore, dear sir, love your solitude and turn the distress it brings you into resonant laments. For you say that those close to you seem distant, and that shows that you are allowing more space around you. If what is close feels far, then your horizon has widened. Be glad for the way you are growing, which is your way, a way you cannot expect of others. Be patient and calm with those who are stuck, and don't torment yourself because they cannot understand your convictions or your joy. Seek with them some simple and true togetherness that does not change when you change. Treasure the life in them as that of another life-form that fears soliutude, and be considerate of those who are afraid to be alone." - Rainer Maria Rilke 
- This is an incredibly poignant paragraph. Spoke with a friend recently who mentioned they spent a day in their apartment alone and couldn't imagine doing that for a long period of time. There is great fear of being alone

"your solitude amid unfamiliar circumstances will be haven and home for you, from which, going forth, you will find your way."
- Following on the previous quote, if we can find a home in our solitude, then we will have the freedom to find our own way in this world. It cannot be guaranteed that we will have company all the time when we accept the call to find our own unique calling. Find comfort in solitude will give you peace no matter where the world takes you on your journey.
