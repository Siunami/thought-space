Memetic species

We want the things that other people want. Founders will flaunt various statistics. "We are funded by so and so venture capital firms".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These waves of wanting splash over all of us constantly. It’s almost impossible to remain unaffected by it, even if you know what to look for.<br><br>The key is to determine your true, intrinsic THICK desires and separate them from your false, extrinsic THIN desires.</p>&mdash; Andrew Wilkinson (@awilkinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1451256238906425354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Thin and thick desires seems like a useful framing and heuristic. The things you would do if no one was watching. Vs the things you see other people have, get a bit jealous, and want as well.

Being willing to stand by something that you believe in. The power of stories and creatives. Empowering them with the tools no matter what.
